Cyber4s#4 Pre-Course final project

link to my code review : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VjHDKTVGAuwdT3yM5P_RFaejcEYK3vZO/view?usp=sharing

my bugs :

   1. player doesn't have to capture Opponent. he has to capture opponent if he selected the piece that can capture opponent.
               
   2. game doesn't end if player can't move anymore.
               
   3. king must stop in the diagonally forward cell after capture Opponent.
